# Image Enhancer

**This simple image enhancer program allows you to denoise and sharpen images interactively. It comes with a basic graphical user interface (GUI) using the `tkinter` library.**

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

**Make sure you have Python installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).**

### Installing Dependencies

**Install the required dependencies using the following command:**

```bash
pip install opencv-python pillow tk
```
###  Running the Program
**Run the image_enhancer.py script to start the image enhancer program:**
````bash
python image_enhancer.py
````
**The program will prompt you to select an image using a file dialog. Once an image is selected, it will be denoised and sharpened, and the enhanced image will be displayed. The program will also save the enhanced image as enhanced_image.jpg in the same directory.**
